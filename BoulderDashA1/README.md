# Boulder Dash production report

### Organisation

We have organized ourselves according to our java capabilities to optimize productivity. For this reason our group has been divided into two groups of two :
1. Arthur LECRAS & Nathan PORET
2. Etienne CANDAT & Gregory DENEUVE

We chose to keep the basic structure for the majority of the diagrams while adding what we needed. Group 1 take care of the View and the Controller. Groupe 2 dealt with the model.

### Diagrams

We started with the class diagrams. Group 1 dealt with the diagrams concerning the View, the Controller, the Main and the Contract. Group 2, for their part, took care of the Model Diagram.

### Code

Group 2 performed all the code for the model and the tests associated with it.
Group 1, shared the tasks : Arthur made the view and Nathan made the controller.

### Other

Group 2 took care of cutting the required sprites one by one so that they would be easier to process.
The GitHub was created by Gregory.
